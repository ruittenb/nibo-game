 - what would need to change if I wanted this game to run correctly scaled on a landscape-oriented mobile device?

 - the escape button should only react to clicks when the player is next to it

 - nav-panel, inventory and valuable-counter - standardized names?

 - display tooltip boven Key Wrench ID card etc

 - z-index tooltips
