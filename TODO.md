 - what would need to change if I wanted this game to run correctly scaled on a landscape-oriented mobile device?
 - the escape button should only react to clicks when the player is next to it
 - rename nav-widget to nav-box, to be in line with inv-box and coin-box
 - the valuable counter variables, do they need to be initialized on 0 ? could we use 0 when looking them up?

 - at S1 L1 P6, the poison position, we don't need a left arrow any more. (in-game and nav-box)
 - at S3 L0 P4, a disease position, we don't need left/right arrows any more. (in-game and nav-box)
 - at S3 L1 P3, a disease position, we don't need left/right arrows any more. (in-game and nav-box)
